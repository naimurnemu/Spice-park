                <p>
                    Hi! i am Michael Ferraro. I culinary career began early on,
                    inspired by My Southern Italian parents and their love and
                    respect for quality and tradition. After graduating from the
                    Culinary Institute of America at age 20, I sought
                    opportunities to further develop my own creativity.

                <h3>A good recipe has two parts</h3>
                <p>
                    A recipe communicates the ingredients and procedures the
                    chef uses to make his creations. It is this tool which
                    allows the chef to train and replicate his skill to his
                    staff.

                            one: mac n' cheese, a classic Reuben sandwich & a

                            My dad would make this dish with tomatoes from our
                            garden when I was a kid. Some of my most memorable
                            childhood flavors of summer.

                            This was one of the dishes I prepared at this year's

                            School . This year's event was an amazing success,
                            raising over $5k for the Pancreatic Cancer Action
